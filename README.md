### I dedicate each day of my life into bringing better software

My goal is help the developer community by writing tools that are easy to use and that have a real meaning, solving real problems. The thing is, when it comes to software, a lot of time could be spent to build it to perfection. But we are often rushed by timelines and companies especially, at the cost of quality. So this is what I focus on: a wider understanding to solve problems that will make **developers' lives easier**.

And to do that, I create packages... But I also share my knowledge to the rest of the community with articles. I think that explaining software is done the hard way and believe in a simpler, yet concise, way of teaching... It's just the words.

Former C, C++, and Java programmer, I completely switched to **JS**, **TS**, and **Functional** programming for amazing adventures.

### Let's write the next big thing for the TypeScript ecosystem

I love fighting complexity. There is nothing worse for a developer than being anxious because of overwhelming cognitive loads. Guess what, TypeScript is our best friend in this quest. A year ago, I started building the [ts-toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt) â€” A collection of superpowers for TypeScript. It offers unique dynamic features, allowing you to write type-safe software more easily and in less time than you do today.

I've learnt many things in my quest for type safety, now I want to go further. More type safety for my fellow developers! I'm actively working on a utility library (similar to lodash/ramda) but that is specifically built with TypeScript in mind. It will harness all the power from the ts-toolbelt to bring near-100% type safety. Like with Rust, if your programs compiles, you will have the guarantee that it won't crash. That said, this is very complex to achieve, and all my TypeScript knowledge will go into this.

And that will just be the base for what comes next! A fully typed ORM, and a fully typed RPC based on WebSockets.


Any kind of support or sponsorship is thickly appreciated, this keeps me going. Thanks :pray:
